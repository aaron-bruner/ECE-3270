# ECE-3270 [Digital Computer Design]
 Course material for ECE-3270 at Clemson University for the Spring semester of 2022.

## Course Description
Design of high-speed ALUs, control and timing circuitry, and asynchronous systems; hands-
on  system  prototyping  with  HDLs  for  FPGA  devices;  current  hardware  topics  related  to 
computer design using modern design methodologies and CAD tools; and principles of system 
design for testability.

## Learning Outcomes
- utilize modern design methodologies (CAD and HDL) 
- design for FPGA devices 
- design finite state machines such as but not limited to control and timing circuitry 
- design high-speed ALUs 
- demonstrate Asynchronous Systems Design principles 
- demonstrate Design for Testability concepts

###### Lab 0
The purpose of this lab is to give hands-on experience working with FPGAs for hardware prototyping and algorithm acceleration. In addition, installing all software and ensuring hardware is functional are lab 0 goals.

###### Lab 1
The purpose of this exercise is to learn how to connect simple input and output devices to an FPGA chip and implement a circuit that uses these devices. Overall, the circuitry will display either the current Fibonacci number or the next. The input will be provided using a 4-Bit binary input through switches.

###### Lab 2
The purpose of this lab is to implement a state machine that keeps track of the current signal status. The state machine will then need to have the libraries signals added to work with OpenCL.
